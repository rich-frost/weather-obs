# weather-obs

This app is a very basic Backbone JS app accessing weather data for a location and displaying on screen.

The idea is to show today's weather observations for a specific location.

## Getting setup

To run this application, you will need to register with the Met Office's DataPoint service to obtain your own API Key.

Once you have this, you can then update the AppConstants file to include your API key and select which location you wish to view data.
